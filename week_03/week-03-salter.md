Gesamtkunstwerk is defined by "art as a whole":combining different art forms to achieve a complete sensory experience. A contemporary digital tool that came to mind that achieves this effect could be the use of virtual reality combined with displaying art. When you can enter a created environment using VR, with merged visual and auditory elements with no "evidence" of its manipulation or outside forces directing, it can feel like you are entering a dream state which I believe is one of the purposes of Gesamtkunstwerk. I had recently gone to see a Lithuanian artist's M.K Ciurlionis's old paintings and music "come to life" through a VR film called "Trail of Angels", where you explore the world within his paintings through your point of view, at times even giving the illusion that you become an angel with wings (you see the shadows of the wings in a reflection and feel like you are "flying" due to visual effects (rising from the ground, seeing your shadow with wings) and sound (wings flapping) accompanied with music. Personally, I exhibited an emotional response as It was very therapeutic and stimulating and I was no longer paying attention to the "reality" outside of the film, due to the film's "magical" feel which I believe would fall under the definition of what Gesamtkunstwerk is.
