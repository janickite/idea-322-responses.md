Define a museum/attraction: Viewing a curated or specific display, usually containing physical objects (historical, cultural, or artistic), in some cases presenting something that occured naturally. Usually in a public space and requiring paying for the experience.Â 

Patterns in mission statements: to educate the public, inspire or bring out a curiosity within the audience, to create perspective, understanding, or experience. 
Things I already own/collect: I used to work as a vet tech so I was allowed to keep my cats' ovaries in formaldehyde when they were spayed, along with certain extracted teeth. I also have a pet snake and keep collections of his sheds, along with bones from different animals that me and my brother found in forest preserves. It could be used for non-professional anatomical education, to learn about different critters/ there is nothing consistent enough to showcase one stable entity. 

I would create a museum of, displaying random individual's favorite songs along with descriptions of people's reasonings why. Each section you could read about a person's life, and their connection to the music. I think i choose this because i connect through others best through sharing and enjoying music with one another.
